# Python Projects - All Levels ðŸš€

Welcome to my Python Projects Repository!  
This repo is a collection of Python projects built as part of my learning journey from beginner to advanced levels.

It includes everything from basic logic-building exercises to full data analysis projects and (in future) web apps and machine learning models.

## ðŸ“Œ Repository Structure:

| Folder | Content |
|------ | ------ |
| Level1_Beginner_Logic | Small logic problems and DSA warmups |
| Level2_Mini_Projects | Simple CLI-based tools and games |
| Level3_Data_Analysis | Python data analysis projects using Pandas and Matplotlib |
| Level4_GUI_Apps | GUI-based projects (Tkinter, coming soon) |
| Level5_Web_Apps | Flask or Django web projects (planned) |
| Level6_Machine_Learning | ML-based Python projects (future scope) |
